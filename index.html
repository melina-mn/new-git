    <p class="explain">Art is somewhat of a therapy that contains everything.
        when the word "Art" is heard, the mind flies to create 
        images to describe "Art" the best way; the first thing that 
        comes to mind is painting, Mona Lisa, that painter who 
        cut his ear for a girl, etc. But "Art" is just more than that. 
        Every branch of art stimulates a part of the human body;
        mentally, physically, emotionally, etc. That is why the article 
        is called "The Art Is You".

    <h2>The connection between art and humans</h2>
    <p class="humans">If the fact that art (a masterpiece) is created by 
        humans, put aside, it can be seen that the human 
        body is also a masterpiece. The human body contains
        an instrument in its larynx, there are billions of books
        in the head that no one has ever read; millions of worlds
        that are built as an imagination, and they could not get
        any more majestic than they are right now. And yet it does
        not seem to be taken care of as it should.</p>

        <section>
        <p class="intro">Knowing all this from the root, it can be seen that everything
            is connected. Art to human body, human body to art,
            art to nature, nature to human body, and so on. Hate
            to break it to you but math and physics have such a
            big role in creating art. Fibonacci is enough to explain all that.</p>
